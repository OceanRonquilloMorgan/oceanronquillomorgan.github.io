# oceanronquillomorgan.com
My <a href="http://oceanronquillomorgan.github.io" target="_blank">personal website</a> to showcase my persona and future projects.

# How It Was Built
This was a three week project over the summer of 2017 which served as my first exposure to web development.

Built from scratch using mainly HTML / CSS  and the Bootstrap framework for responsiveness along with a dash of Javascript and jQuery for the USC-related easter egg on the website. Not too hard to find ;-)

Continuous updates and features as they come along.

# Future Plans

My next step is to increase the responsiveness of the site using Javascript to preload icons and to fix any cross-browser formatting / display incontingencies. I also wish to add modals for future projects.
