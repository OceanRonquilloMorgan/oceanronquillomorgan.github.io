# oceanronquillomorgan.com
My personal website to showcase my persona and future projects.

# How It Was Built
This was a three week project over the summer of 2017 which served as my first exposure to web development.

Built from scratch using mainly HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Bootstrap framework for responsiveness.

# Future Plans

My next step is to increase the responsiveness of the site using Javascript to preload icons and to fix any cross-browser formatting / display incontingencies.

Also, in the future, I would like to add a USC-related easter egg to the website which primarily involves the neat little SC logo at the top left corner of the page.
