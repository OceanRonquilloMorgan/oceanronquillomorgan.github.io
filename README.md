My <a href="http://oceanronquillomorgan.github.io" target="_blank">personal website</a> to showcase my persona and future projects.

# How It Was Built
This was a three week project over the summer of 2017 which served as my first exposure to web development. Continuous updates and features as they come along.

Built from scratch using mainly HTML / CSS  and the Bootstrap framework for responsiveness along with a dash of jQuery for the USC-related easter egg on the website. Not too hard to find ;-)

# Future Plans

My next step is to increase the responsiveness of the site using Javascript to preload icons and to fix any cross-browser formatting / display incontingencies.
